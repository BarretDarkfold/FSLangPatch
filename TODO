? Update translated language list in every FS official language
- Add feature to provide proper fallbacks for language variety translations (like Kansai Japanese (ja_KS) would default to ja, not en):
    * preferably use file links, check if FS supports them in Linux (OK), Windows; otherwise copy files. Python doc says link creating does not work in Mac.
    * files will be fetched recursively (ex: ja_KS_KYOTO -> ja_KS -> ja)
    * .xml.patch will first try to fetch a default file before giving up;
