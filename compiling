NOTE: You don't absolutely need to compile the patching tool to patch Firestorm.
You can use the binary in the release, or, if the binary does not work for you, you can install python and python3-plyer, and run the .py script.

1. Installing required packages
===============================
python3
python3-plyer
pip

2. Preparing environment
===============================
Run the following command:
pip install pyinstaller
(will install the required dependencies)

3. Compiling
===============================
Run the following command:
(Linux) pyinstaller --collect-submodules plyer.platforms.linux --onefile firestorm_lang_patcher.py
(Windows) pyinstaller --collect-submodules plyer.platforms.win --onefile firestorm_lang_patcher.py
(OSX) pyinstaller --collect-submodules plyer.platforms.mac --onefile firestorm_lang_patcher.py

Binary executable will be in ./dist ; make sure to move it where the patch folders are, otherwise it will find nothing to patch.
You can delete the ./build folder after compiling.
