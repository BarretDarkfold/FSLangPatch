Before beginning, please look up the ISO 639 (Set 1) two-letter language code:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes
Language codes are NOT ALWAYS THE SAME AS COUNTRY CODES. Make sure to use language code, not country!


=== LANGUAGE VARIETIES ===

Our system supports language varieties.
To specify a variety, add _ followed by country code.

For example, Australian English is "en_AU".

Our system even supports subvarieties, without any limit!

For example, Valencian variety of Catalan would be "ca_ES_VALENCIAN" (ca = Catalan, ES = Spain);
Australian Pirate English would be "en_AU_PIRATE";
Black Pirate Canadian French would be "fr_CA_PIRATE_BLACK".

Any missing file in language variety translations will be automatically added from its direct parent.
In the above example, missing translation files from "fr_CA_PIRATE_BLACK" would be taken from "fr_CA_PIRATE", if still missing, from "fr_CA", and if still missing, from "fr".

Missing translations from base languages will default to English as per Firestorm's coding, but there might be glitches, so be careful!


=== ADDING A LANGUAGE OR LANGUAGE VARIETY ===

There are four .xml.patch files to modify:
1) In app_settings/settings.xml.patch :
   Add the language or language variety before the sort tag.

2) In skins/default/default_languages.xml.patch :
   Add the language or language variety before the sort tag.

3) In skins/default/xui/en/floater_translation_settings.xml.patch :
   Add the language or language variety before the sort tag.

4) In skins/default/xui/en/panel_preferences_general.xml.patch :
   Add the language or language variety before the sort tag.


== ADDING THE TRANSLATIONS THEMSELVES ===

Add them in folders named with their ISO 639 code (see above) or combination of ISO 639, variety and subvarieties.
The folders must be inside the "xui" folders, under each of the skin you want to translate.
It is a good idea to at least provide most of translations for "default" and "firestorm" skins:

skins/default/xui
skins/firestorm/xui

For example, Mexico Spanish translations would be located in :

skins/default/xui/es_MX
skins/firestorm/xui/es_MX
