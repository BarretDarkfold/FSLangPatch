Before beginning, please look up the ISO 639 (Set 1) two-letter language code:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes
Language codes are NOT ALWAYS THE SAME AS COUNTRY CODES. Make sure to use language code, not country!


=== LANGUAGE VARIETIES ===

Language varieties are supported.
To specify a variety, add _ followed by country code.

For example, Australian English is "en_AU".

Even subvarieties are supported, without any limit!

For example, Valencian variety of Catalan would be "ca_ES_VALENCIAN" (ca = Catalan, ES = Spain);
Black Pirate Canadian French would be "fr_CA_PIRATE_BLACK".

And you don't have to provide all translation files. Here's why.

Before being patched, any missing language variety translation file will be fetched from its closest parent to its furthest, with preference on proximity.
In the above example, missing translation files from "fr_CA_PIRATE_BLACK" would be taken from "fr_CA_PIRATE", if still missing, from "fr_CA", and if still missing, from "fr".
Also, parents are always treated first. To summarize:

1) "fr" will be patched (if any patching files present, overriding what is there)
2) missing files in "fr_CA" will be copied from "fr"
2) "fr_CA" will be patched (if any patching files present, overriding what is there)
3) missing files in "fr_CA_PIRATE" will be copied from "fr_CA", otherwise from "fr"
4) "fr_CA_PIRATE" will be patched (if any patching files present, overriding what is there)
5) missing files in "fr_CA_PIRATE_BLACK" will be copied from "fr_CA_PIRATE", otherwise from "fr_CA", otherwise from "fr"
6) "fr_CA_PIRATE_BLACK will be patched (if any patching files present, overriding what is there)

Missing translations from base languages will default to English as per Firestorm's coding, but there might be glitches, so be careful!


=== ADDING A LANGUAGE OR LANGUAGE VARIETY ===

Some of the xml files are rather large and to keep up with any updates FS does to them, we have created a .xml.patch format,
that allows to only specify what to add and where. There are four of them.

1) app_settings/settings.xml.patch :
   Add the language or language variety before the sort tag.

2) skins/default/default_languages.xml.patch :
   Add the language or language variety before the sort tag.

3) skins/default/xui/en/floater_translation_settings.xml.patch :
   Add the language or language variety before the sort tag.

4) skins/default/xui/en/panel_preferences_general.xml.patch :
   Add the language or language variety before the sort tag.


== ADDING THE TRANSLATIONS THEMSELVES ===

Add the xml files in in folders named with their ISO 639 code (see above) or combination of ISO 639, variety and subvarieties.
The folders must be inside the "xui" folders, under each of the skin you want to translate.
It is a good idea to at least provide most of translations for "default" and "firestorm" skins:

skins/default/xui
skins/firestorm/xui

For example, Mexico Spanish translations would be located in :

skins/default/xui/es_MX
skins/firestorm/xui/es_MX
