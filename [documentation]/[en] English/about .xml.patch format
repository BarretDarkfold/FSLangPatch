The .xml.patch files allow patching non-translation files even if they have changed in a new viewer version.
The missing XML tags will be added at the suitable place.

=== FORMATTING THE FILE ===
Keep the whole tree above the elements you want to add, and the elements themselves. You don't need to keep any sibiling element.

=== SORTING ELEMENTS ===
If you want to order a list of elements, add a sort tag after the last one you add:

<sort key="[key]" prepends="[list of prepends]"/>
   where:
[key] is the name of the attribute that contains text to be sorted. (if you want to use text between the tags, use "_text")
[list of prepends] is a comma-separated list of key values that must be ignored; the element they belong to will not be sorted and will be prepended at the beginning of the list.

Comments that contain a sibling will also be sorted like if they were not commented;
Comments that do not contain a sibling will be prepended.

For example:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" standalone="yes"?>
<floater>
 <combo_box allow_text_entry="true" follows="left|top" height="23" left_pad="10" max_chars="135" mouse_opaque="true" name="translate_language_combo" top_delta="-5" width="190">
  <combo_box.item label="Català (Catalan)" name="Catalan" value="ca" />
  <combo_box.item label="Français canadien (French)" name="Canadian_French" value="fr_CA" />
  <sort key="label" prepends="System Default,English"/>
 </combo_box>
</floater>

The above patch will:

1) Add two "Català (Catalan)" and Français canadien (French)" combo box items;
2) List unsorted "System Default" and "English" combo box items and the comments not containing any element;
2) List sorted all other combo box items by their label, including those we added and those that are commented.
