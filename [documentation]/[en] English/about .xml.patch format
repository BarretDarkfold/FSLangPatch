The .xml.patch files are XML files that tell what to patch in another XML file and how to perform it.
Any missing XML tag in target file will be added at the suitable place.


=== FORMATTING THE FILE ===

Keep the whole tree above the elements to be added, and the elements themselves. You don't need to keep any sibiling element.


=== COMMENTING AN ELEMENT ===

Insert commented version of the element; the program will update it.
All matching elements at the tree location will be updated.


=== UNCOMMENTING AN ELEMENT ===

Insert uncommented version of the element; the program will update it.
All matching elements at the tree location will be updated.


=== SORTING ELEMENTS IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER ===

Add a <sort> tag after the last element one to add (it will not be added to the final XML):

<sort key="[key]" prepends="[prepends]"/>
   where:
[key] is the name of the attribute that contains text to be sorted. For the text between the tags, use "_text".
[prepends] is a comma-separated list of key values of an element that must not be sorted and be kept at the beginning of the list.

Comments that contain a sibling element will also be sorted just like if that element was not commented.
Comments that do not contain a sibling element will be prepended.

For example:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" standalone="yes"?>
<floater>
 <combo_box allow_text_entry="true" follows="left|top" height="23" left_pad="10" max_chars="135" mouse_opaque="true" name="translate_language_combo" top_delta="-5" width="190">
  <combo_box.item label="Català (Catalan)" name="Catalan" value="ca" />
  <combo_box.item label="Français canadien (French)" name="Canadian_French" value="fr_CA" />
  <sort key="label" prepends="System Default,English"/>
 </combo_box>
</floater>

The above patch will:

1) Add "Català (Catalan)" and "Français canadien (French)" combo box items;
2) List "System Default" and "English" combo box items, as well as the comments not containing a combo box item;
3) Sort and list all other combo box items by their "label" attribute, including those we added and those that are commented.
