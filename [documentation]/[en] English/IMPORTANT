IMPORTANT

The program will not both replace and patch a file. In the patch folder, for each target file, please keep only either a .xml or .xml.patch.

These two methods of patching are different. The former replaces the whole file as is, while the second describes how to patch it.

There are no cases where both would be needed, so use one or the other, not both!
