NOTE: You don't have to compile anything to patch Firestorm.
This guide is for people who would like to redistribute.

1. Installing required packages
===============================
python3
python3-plyer
pip

2. Preparing environment
===============================
Run the following command:
pip install pyinstaller
(will install the required dependencies)

3. Compiling
===============================
Run the following command:
(in Linux) pyinstaller --collect-submodules plyer.platforms.linux --onefile firestorm_lang_patcher.py
(in Windows) pyinstaller --collect-submodules plyer.platforms.win --onefile firestorm_lang_patcher.py
(in OSX) pyinstaller --collect-submodules plyer.platforms.mac --onefile firestorm_lang_patcher.py

Binary executable will be in ./dist ; make sure to move it where the patch folders are, otherwise it will find nothing to patch.
You can delete the ./build folder after compiling.
